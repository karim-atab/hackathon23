21/02/2023,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,I am dissatisfied with the current outcome of a dispute that was initiated with Discover Card regarding a single transaction that occurred on XXXX/XXXX/2015 in the amount of {$280.00}. I have corresponded with Discover Card at least four times since XXXX/XXXX/2015 ( which I have enclosed as an attachment to this complaint ). I believe that the credit card issuer has violated consumer protection laws by failing to implement the Special Rule for Credit Card Purchase protection despite overwhelming paperwork evidence submitted by me that shows the merchant has conducted business in bad faith less favorable to the consumer. I have sustained a monetary loss as a result of merchants bad faith and intent. I have patiently utilized the internal Discover Card dispute process over the past three months with the credit card issuer always favoring the merchant ; I have repeatedly submitted irrefutable paperwork evidence that has shown that the merchant has conducted business in bad faith. I have tried in good faith to address my complaint with the merchant and Discover Card but believe that I will not receive a favorable outcome.,,DISCOVER BANK,NV,891XX,,Consent provided,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1816726,Low

One of my trucks needed a repair. I hired a mechanic to do the repair on XX/XX/XXXX. He told us he installed new batteries and a new starter on the truck. The mechanic stated his work was guaranteed and I paid him with my TD Bank XXXX credit card {$2300.00} for this repair. When my driver went to start the truck for work the next day, the truck did not work/start again. We tried calling/texting mechanic to let him know the truck was not working even though the previous day he said he fixed the truck. I have the texts and phone records showing we were reaching out to the mechanic with no response from him. I had to hire another mechanic to fix truck again and found out the parts put in my truck by the first mechanic were wrong. I filed a dispute on XX/XX/XXXX for the above transaction with my TD Bank XXXX credit card. Even though I paid the first mechanic {$2300.00}, my dispute amount was for only {$1300.00} because that amount is for the wrong parts. The credit card company requested proof of records and a second estimate for work done on truck. I overnighted a package on XX/XX/XXXX to the credit card company. Within a day or two that is when the dispute department requested a second estimate. The dispute department stated I had only until XX/XX/XXXX to submit the second estimate documentation. So I faxed the second estimate on XX/XX/XXXX which was the same date the dispute department received my overnight package. When I called to followup on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX the dispute department stated they never received second estimate needed for dispute, even though I had a fax confirmation transmission stating the fax was sent. So I sent fax again onXX/XX/XXXX ( which was the deadline for this documentation ) and received fax confirmation sheet stating the fax was sent. TD Bank XXXX credit card stated they never received second estimate in time and they closed my dispute. So even though I did everything they requested in the time they wanted because of the failure on their end with not receiving fax ( even though I have proof ), my company lost when I should be protected by the "" XXXX '' logo.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NJ,,,Consent provided,Web,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2874325,Medium

As a result of a series of legislation called Act 10, I was forced to take a cut in take home pay of almost XXXX per month. I immediately began trying to work with XXXX XXXX XXXX to modify my home loan into something affordable. I was told that I had to be 45 days behind in order to start a modification process, so I allowed myself to fall behind to start the process ( I was running about 29 days late prior ). After 3 years of attempting to work with them, including lost paperwork, inaccurate claims ( ie home vacant when it was n't ), and changes in case workers, etc I finally contacted my local State Representative who managed to get XXXX XXXX XXXX to work with me. XX/XX/XXXX, I finally had a modification offer but it modified my home to over {$170000.00}. My home is only worth about {$69000.00}. When I asked about modifying it down to what it was worth, I was told to sign the modification and then XXXX XXXX XXXX would work on adjusting the modification down to its value. The only reason the amount was so high was due to XXXX XXXX XXXX taking over 3 years to modify my mortgage and their ineptitude with the process. XX/XX/XXXX, I was offered a job in XXXX, ND which I then accepted. My preference at that time, would have been to have to modification at the value of my home and then to rent the home out. As XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to honor their earlier agreement of renegotiating the modification down to the value of the home, it has now fallen into foreclosure and is vacant. After XXXX XXXX XXXX sold my mortgage to Carrington Mortgage-while in the middle of a modification, in XXXX XXXX, I again attempted the process and was denied any options. When I called to work with the company, I was told, on several occasions, different things. Once I was told to go ahead and short sale it, only to receive a letter later stating that was not possible. I also received a letter stating that I did not qualify for any options. XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from a law firm representing XXXX XXXX XXXX that my foreclosure was being reopened. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received the attached legal work stating the foreclosure was in the 3 month redemption. After contacting both Carrington and XXXX XXXX XXXX over the course of the last 4 months, I have been told each other owns the mortgage, no one has foreclosed, the process has not been started, it has been started, XXXX XXXX XXXX is not allowed to do that, we do n't own the loan, we do own the loan, etc. My last conversation with Carrington stated that they are selling the mortgage effective XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and will not do anything with it, while the attorney for XXXX XXXX XXXX is trying to move forward with the foreclosure. I have been dealing with this for almost 4 years, with no solution in sight when this should have been completed over 3 years ago. I have attached some of the RMAs, etc and have most paperwork available ( about XXXX pages worth ).",,"CARRINGTON MORTGAGE SERVICES, LLC",ND,585XX,,Consent provided,Web,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2189912,Low

This is my 14th dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a representative and inquired how XXXX, XXXX and Experian verifies their public records.

I had 20 representatives that told me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse through XXXX. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau.

They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved. She advised that they use a form that they send over to the courthouse.

My monthly statements are consistently reflecting 2 months of payments due. I have contacted the mortgage company every month to better understand why this is occurring, as I am submitting my monthly payments well before the XXXX of each month. Initially i received a statement for XXXX reflecting 2 months due for my mortgage ( XXXX & XXXX ). I noted a correspondence that stated my loan was sold at the end of XXXX, but no account information provided by new service provider SUNTRUST. I reached out to SUNTRUST to make an online payment prior to XX/XX/XXXX to maintain my account current.

However for the XXXX Billing statement did not understand why still showing 2 payments being due. I contacted SUNTRUST on XX/XX/XXXX and was told my billing cycle was occurring every XXXX of the month, as this was automatically set-up by the system. Additionally I had mailed hard-copy checks this month, as needed to make up an escrow shortage. Understanding this billing cycle I sent my XXXX payment on XX/XX/18 via epay for XXXX XXXX account. I visited the website again on XX/XX/18 only to see my payment not yet posted. XXXX XXXX show funds withdrawn from my account on XX/XX/2018.

28/01/2023,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I am currently on a HAMP loan that was originated in 2013. Under HAMP I was suppose to receive at {$1000.00} credit each year after 12 consecutive payments are made on time. It is clearly written in my modification documents. Each year after 12 months of consecutive payments, I have called Mr Cooper to request the credit. I have always had automatically payments set up with them so all payments have been on time. They always tell me that I am only eligible after the full 5 years of payments is completed. I am now beyond the 5 years since origination. I have been trying to contact Mr Cooper regarding my incentive credit under the program. Mr Cooper representatives keep saying it will be processed shortly and that I will receive written notice. I have not received anything in over 5 years and have been calling every month or two for status for the last 4 yrs. They refuse to put anything in writing even after numerous request for written confirmation they are processing the incentive credit. Mr Cooper 's website does not have option to send email so that I can receive written response. I have tried to calling Making Homes Affordable counselor for assistance, but they have been unwilling to help, but did tell me that the lender is suppose to give me the credit each year after consecutive 12 monthly payments are made on time, not after 60 months. They also indicated that I should also be eligible for up to {$5000.00} credit if I make 12 consecutive payments on time in the 6th year.

This company never sent any correspondence to me that would have informed me of any alleged debt they were attempting to collect. Further, by not receiving any correspondence from them, did not allow me to dispute the validity of their claim. to that end, I submitted a dispute to XXXX XXXX ( although the company was truly Accelerated Receivables ), the address reflected was to Accelerated Receivables. This too is a violation. If they are attempting to collect on a debt, then their name should have been listed and not the alleged original creditor. Accelerated Receivables never responded. So I then sent a copy of the certified letter with return receipt to XXXX to verify that the company did not respond to my dispute letter and the entries should be deleted. The entries were deleted from XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I again retrieved a copy of my report an found that Accelerated Receivables had reported these same 4 derogatory accounts, that do not belong to me, on my XXXX   report. I disputed with XXXX but to no avail. XXXX responded well after 30 days only to state the accounts were verified. I submitted a response to their findings by inquiring as to how they were able to get a response from Accelerated and my efforts were not successful as the company just blatantly disregarded my dispute. I then escalated this dispute to the CFPB against XXXX and at XXXX ( as it appeared on my credit report ). It took XXXX over 60 days to respond to the CFPB only to state that they would send a letter with the results from the investigation to me. Again, I received the same letter whereby XXXX stated the accounts were mine. 

I then sent Accelerated Receivables another letter ( second attempt ) dated XX/XX/XXXX whereby I once again requested that they provide validation of these entries belonging to me. This letter was sent certified with a return receipt and to date, I have not received any correspondence from this company. Additionally, I requested that they provide a copy of the financial responsibility page for the accounts they are alleging I owe. Again, to no avail.

My wife, my XXXX old daughter, and I were designated as "" potentially compromised. '' My wife and I could sign up for their identity theft monitoring, but their online system would not allow a minor to sign up.

She could not explain why my daughter 's SSN would be in their system. She said that I would need to call Equifax directly, but she did not even have the number to call. 

Trying to contact Equifax directly has been futile. They have deliberately obfuscated any direct way of contacting them. So far, I can not even determine a simple question -- does the SSN associated with my baby have any credit history or other association with Equifax? According to one rep, the answer should be "" no, '' but she can not confirm it. 

So far, the only way I think I may get any answers is sending copies of important, sensitive documents ( my and my daughter 's SS cards, birth certificates, etc ) directly to Equifax. Since they could not protect the data of 143 million people, I really do n't want to add my daughter 's information to their company if it does not already exist.

They refuse to provide information to consumers that substantiate the outcome of their investigations. Sadly, Chex also adds inaccurate information to consumer files at the whim of their broken administrative processes. 

ChexSystems absolves themselves of any responsibility for the accuracy of information contained in their systems, but instead casts responsibility to their customers, and forces the consumer to address problems directly with ChexSystems customers, unless providing a police report. Unfortunately some police agencies do n't issue "" police reports '' when a crime has not been clearly consummated.
